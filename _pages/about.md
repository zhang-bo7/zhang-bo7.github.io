I'm a third-year Master's student from Southeast University. My research interests include intelligent robotics and embodied AI. 
Previously, I interned at the Intel Intelligent Edge Computing Joint Research Institute for six months, focusing on humanoid robot development. My work involved training gait algorithms with reinforcement learning and deploying on the Pi-0 for VLA operations.
You can learn more about me on my [Personal Website](https://zhang-bo7.github.io/).
